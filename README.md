# 🎮 rb-anti-afk: Roblox Anti-AFK Macro 🖱️💨

I basically made this just to try something new and because I'm tired of getting kicked out when going afk in grow a garden, yes... I play roblox to kill time. `rb-anti-afk` is a simple macro that periodically moves your mouse to keep you in the game.

## Features

*   **🖱️ Automatic Mouse Movement:** Simulates small mouse movements at set intervals.
*   **⚙️ Configurable:**
    *   Set the **interval** (how often the mouse moves).
    *   Set the **pixel distance** (how far the mouse moves).
*   **🎯 Roblox Focused:** Only moves the mouse when a "Roblox" window is active and focused.

## How

The app uses `pydirectinput` to simulate mouse movements and `pygetwindow` to detect if the "Roblox" game client is the active window. The UI allows you to configure the movement interval and distance.


## How to use

1.  **Download:** Grab the latest `.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/rywndr/rb_macro/releases).
2.  **Run:** Double-click the `.exe` file.
3.  **Configure:**
    *   Select how often you want the mouse to move (in seconds).
    *   Select how many pixels the mouse should move.
4.  **Start:** Click the "Start" button.
5.  **Play** Keep your Roblox game window active and focused. The macro will only work when Roblox is the active window.
